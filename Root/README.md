Speciation: The Great Divergence (2015-2025)
🎯 Project Overview
This project investigates the fundamental "Speciation" of the video game industry. It analyzes how the market has split into two distinct economic and creative ecosystems: AAA (High-Fidelity / Hardware-Exclusivity) and Indie (Creative-Agility / Distribution-Resiliency).

📊 Key Analytical Scenes
The analysis is structured into six "Scenes" derived from RAWG metadata, providing a narrative-driven look at the industry's evolution:

Scene 1: The Invasion of Volume – Identifying the "Complexity Ceiling" (5-7 year AAA cycles) vs. the exponential climb of Indie releases.

Scene 2: The Innovation Gap – How AAA studios "play it safe" with established IPs while Indies colonize mechanical niches like Strategy and Puzzle.

Scene 3: Habitat Divergence – A look at Hardware Stratification: AAA's focus on high-end consoles vs. Indie dominance on PC.

Scene 4: The Hardware Moat – Using exclusivity as a risk-mitigation shield for high-budget titles.

Scene 5: Distribution Resilience – How Indies utilize "Ubiquity" across multiple storefronts to create a survival safety net.

Scene 6: The Quality Myth – Comparing AAA’s technical consistency (High Floor) against the industry-leading creative peaks of the Indie sector (High Ceiling).

📂 Repository Structure
data_pipeline.ipynb: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, tiers categorization, and Plotly visualization logic.

enriched_final_dataset.csv: The processed dataset used for all analysis and visuals.

requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to reproduce the environment.

documentation: API documentation and metadata structure references used for the data pipeline.

/output: The final interactive HTML storyboard report for stakeholders.

🛠️ Installation & Usage
Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/emaheshwarigrid/Great-Divergence.git
Install Dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Analysis: Open data_pipeline.ipynb in your preferred editor. The notebook is configured to read the dataset from the root directory.

🏁 Future Scope
Sub-Genre "Hot Spot" Identification: Pinpointing niche genres currently underserved by AAA but showing high player interest.

Platform Efficiency Index: Determining which hardware ecosystems provide the highest return on investment for each funding tier.
